# acropolisPrototype
This is a bare bones prototype showcasing the main menu and planet selection mechanic. The only selectable planet and region is "planetP101-1" and "Region 1".
Other Planets and regions are unavailable at this time.
When the level representing Region 1 of planetP191-1 is loaded you will not be able to interact or place any buildings onto the level. This is more of a showcase of what the level looks like when you enter it first time.
